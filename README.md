Why hello there. It's been several years. Maybe you heard about Gravity from [the article](https://medium.com/swlh/turning-the-iphone-6s-into-a-digital-scale-f2197dc2b6e7) I wrote about it that went viral? I didn't release it publicly for a long time because I was afraid it wouldn't sit well with Apple (a few phone calls made it apparently that they weren't the biggest fans of the app) and I was about to launch Blackbox …but also because I was embarassed that I hadn't rewritten the app in Swift yet nor had I removed the whole calibration step which we thought might be necessary before playing with the devices themselves and realizing they were quite consistent from device to device! 

Anyway with 3D touch essentially dead and tons of people always asking me for the code I've decided to get over my perfectionism and just open source the damn thing. If you want to rewrite it in Swift, make PRs, etc please go for it. The only thing I ask is that you don't submit scale apps to the app store but you already know that.
